# Moviement
- Moviement is a comprehensive platform that enables users to create insightful (takes) of the films they've seen. These takes create not only an insightful perspective of different snaps throughout the film that the user wants to elaborate on, but also creates an interactive website for users to review other users' work. With Moviement, you don't just share casual reviews; you create "takes'' â€“ powerful, insightful snapshots into the heart of the conversation.
